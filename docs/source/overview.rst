Overview
********

CypherCat is a Python package for testing adversarial attacks
and defenses in deep learning architectures across multiple 
data applications.


------------------------------
What is an adversarial attack?
------------------------------

In an ideal world, we would have access to the perfect model:
one whose parameters and data used to train would be perfectly
hidden and non-inferable. 
However, in real life:

- models have been trained with gradient descent
- data sets are not infinite
